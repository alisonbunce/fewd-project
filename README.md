Final Project FEWD
For my final FEWD project I took an active business problem and created an MVP solution using HTML and JS.

The business problem: Business users in Upper level management don't understand the value in the application S4.

Context: There are 4 different departments thats service data needs to internal employees (in some capacity)

The project: Create a marketing campaign help users understand the value to eventually evangelize S4

Project proposal: Create a flyer that featured quotes of the value of s4

My solution: Create a user prompted search tool that allowed the user to discover and understand the value of s4 on their on, based on their needs. And then be able to track/assess future user needs.
